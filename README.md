# Simple Nutrition

A Fabric Minecraft mod to move players towards a more balanced diet.

The focus is on a simple implementation which doesn't apply healthy or unhealthy
properties to eatable items, but instead looks for a diverse plate.

The principle is simple. If you eat similar food repeatedly, you will
get small side effects. If you still continue eating the same food, bigger
side effects may appear too, like Food Poisoning.
